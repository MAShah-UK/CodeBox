## Covered Material
* **Assignments**
  * QACinemas - Implemented a ticket booking system for a hypothetical cinema chain.
* **Concepts**
  * BigO - Provides a measure of how algorithm scales with input data.
  * JavaFundamentals - Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
* **Data Structures**
  * ArrayList - Dynamically resizing array.
  * BinarSearchTree - Stores data in tree structure. Each node points to two nodes with small
  * LinkedList - Each node points to next node. 
  * MinStack - Returns minimum element in O(1) time.
  * Queue - First in first out data structure.
  * Stack - Last in first out data structure.
* **Exercises**
  * AddLargeNumbers - Uses strings to represent large numbers and add them together.
  * AnagramStrings - Determines whether two strings can be rearranged to form each other (whitespace ignored).
  * ArrayBinarySearch - Applies binary search to an array, eliminating half of the possibilities in each iteration.
  * BalancedBrackets - Uses stack to determine if brackets in a string are balanced, e.g. "{()[()]}" is, "(()" isn't.
  * FindPairsForN - Determines pairs of numbers from an array that add up to a target value.
  * MaxShareProfit - Determines maximum profit given share history over a period of time.
  * PalindromeString - Determines if strings are in reverse order of each other.
  * PascalsTriangle - Returns the nth line of Pascal's triangle.
  * ReverseString - Reverses string by switching opposing elements, e.g. 1st element with last, 2nd element with 2nd last, etc.
* **Sorting**
  * BubbleSort - Inefficient, but quick to implement. Average time complexity O(n^2).
  * FrequencySort - Sorts arrays in order of element frequency.
  * MergeSort - Very fast sort. Worst case is O(nlogn), but requires O(n) memory.
  * QuickSort - Fast sort. Average case is O(nlogn). Worst case is O(n^2). Requires O(1) memory.
