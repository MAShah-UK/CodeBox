## Covered Material
* **Assignments**
  * QACinemas - Implemented a ticket booking system for a hypothetical cinema chain.
* **Concepts**
  * BigO - Provides a measure of how algorithm scales with input data.
  * JavaFundamentals - Abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism.
* **Data Structures**
  * ArrayList - Dynamically resizing array.
<<<<<<< HEAD
  * BinarySearchTree - Stores data in tree structure. Each node points to two nodes with small.
  * LinkedList - Each node points to right node.
=======
  * BinarySearchTree - Stores data in tree structure. Each node points to two further nodes. Searches in O(logn).
  * HashMap - Stores data in buckets/arrays using a hashcode. Get and put operations complete in O(1) in best case.
  * LinkedList - Each node points to next node.

  * LinkedListTable - Elements are added/accessed using row and column indicies. Table can be flattened into an array.
  * LRUCacheHM - LRU cache implemented using a HashMap. Elements are ordered, and removed, by access time.
  * LRUCacheLHM - Least recently used cache implemented using a LinkedHashMap.
  * MinStack - Returns minimum element in O(1) time. Uses another stack to keep track of minimum value.
  * Queue - First in first out data structure. Uses head and tail references to manage both ends of a list of nodes.
  * Stack - Last in first out data structure.
* **Exercises**
  * AddLargeNumbers - Uses strings to represent large numbers and add them together.
  * AnagramStrings - Determines whether two strings can be rearranged to form each other (whitespace ignored).
  * ArrayBinarySearch - Applies binary search to an array, eliminating half of the possibilities in each iteration.
  * BalancedBrackets - Uses stack to determine if brackets in a string are balanced, e.g. "{()[()]}" is, "(()" isn't.
  * FindPairsForN - Determines pairs of numbers from an array that add up to a target value.
  * IsSubstring - Determines if one of two input strings is a substring of the other.
  * MaxShareProfit - Determines maximum profit given share history over a period of time.
  * PalindromeString - Determines if strings are in reverse order of each other.
  * PascalsTriangle - Returns the nth line of Pascal's triangle.
  * ReverseString - Reverses string by swapping elements, e.g. 1st element with last, 2nd element with 2nd last, etc.
  * TableBinarySearch - Uses binary search on a 2D array. Each element must be in increasing order.
  * TableStairSearch - Uses stair search on a 2D array. Each row must be in increasing order.
* **Sorting**
  * BubbleSort - Inefficient, but quick to implement. Average time complexity O(n^2).
  * FrequencySort - Sorts arrays in order of element frequency.
  * MergeSort - Very fast sort. Worst case is O(nlogn), but requires O(n) memory.
  * QuickSort - Fast sort. Average case is O(nlogn). Worst case is O(n^2). Requires O(1) memory.
